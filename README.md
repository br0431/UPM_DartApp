## Description
Our app is useful for those users that like to do any type of sport. In this app they will be able to plan a route or see routes that are already defined by other users (in future releases), also you can check the weather based on the map coordinates to see if the rain could cancel your plans. The difference with other apps is that you have a lot of freedom here to stablish your rutes and do sport plans.
