## Description
SportNav is a mobile application designed for finding and managing sports centers,
as well as organizing events related to these centers. These centers can include a
variety of facilities such as sports complexes, soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis
and padel courts, as well as training centers like gyms, swimming clubs, climbing
centers, and more.
This application offers a wide range of features, including user location and
coordinate management. It incorporates a map developed with OpenStreetMaps that
allows users to create markers, plan routes, and visualize sports centers on the map
with their respective icons and names within a certain radius. Users can also view
the current weather at their location and maintain a list of favorite centers.
Additionally, SportNav includes a dedicated screen for managing saved favorite
centers. One of the most notable features is the creation of activities related to these
centers and the ability for users to register for activities in their area. This ensures
that users can easily find and participate in sports events and activities near them,
fostering a more active and engaged community.
The application makes use of various technologies, including multi platform
development with Flutter, Room database for data storage, Retrofit for handling API
calls, Firebase for authentication and real-time database, and OpenStreetMaps API
for mapping functionality.
Overall, SportNav aims to streamline the process of discovering and utilizing sports
facilities, enhancing user experience through comprehensive location-based services
and community-driven event organization.
